# README Generator

This project uses the Gemini API to automatically generate a README.md file for a given project folder.  It analyzes the files within the folder, extracts relevant information, and constructs a comprehensive README file including an introduction, features, installation instructions, usage examples, project structure, and example usage.  It also handles optional data and image folders.

## Features

- Automatically generates a README.md file.
- Analyzes the contents of a source folder.
- Includes descriptions of files and their content previews.
- Supports optional data and image folders.
- Generates descriptions for images using Gemini's image analysis capabilities.
- Customizable output language (currently only English is fully supported).
- Handles potential errors during file reading and API requests.
- Uses retries to handle rate limiting from the Gemini API.


## Installation

1.  Install Python 3: Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2.  Install required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install requests argparse json
    ```
3.  Obtain a Google Gemini API Key:  You need a valid API key to use the Gemini API.  Follow Google's instructions to obtain one.  Set the `API_KEY` variable in `src/generatereadme.sh` with your key.
4.  Set GOOGLE_MODEL: Set the `GOOGLE_MODEL` variable in `src/generatereadme.sh` to the correct Gemini model URL.


## Usage

The script takes the path to the source folder as a required argument.  Optional arguments allow specifying the output folder, language, output filename, and paths to data and image folders.

```bash
python src/generatereadme.sh <path_to_source_folder> [-o <output_folder>] [-l <language>] [-f <output_filename>] [-d <data_folder>] [-i <images_folder>]
```

Example:

```bash
python src/generatereadme.sh ./myproject -o ./docs -f MyProjectREADME.md -d ./data -i ./images
```

This command will process the `myproject` folder, save the README file as `MyProjectREADME.md` in the `docs` folder, include data from the `data` folder, and descriptions of images from the `images` folder.


## Project Structure

-   [src/generatereadme.sh](./src/generatereadme.sh): The main Python script that generates the README file.  This file contains the core logic for processing files, making API calls to Gemini, and generating the Markdown content.


## Example Usage

Let's assume you have a project folder named `myproject` with a few files and an `images` folder.  Running the script:

```bash
python src/generatereadme.sh ./myproject
```

will generate a `README.md` file in the `myproject` directory containing a structured overview of your project's files and content.  If you include an `images` folder, the generated README will include descriptions and images from that folder.  The exact content of the README will depend on the files and images present in your project folder.


## Data Files (If applicable)

This section will be populated if a `-d` flag is used, listing the files in the specified data folder and their descriptions.


## Screenshot (If applicable)

This section will be populated if a `-i` flag is used, showing images from the specified image folder, each preceded by a description generated by the Gemini API.


Note:  Remember to replace placeholders like `YOUR_GOOGLE_API` with your actual API key.  The script requires an active internet connection to communicate with the Google Gemini API.  Error handling is included to manage potential issues like network errors and API rate limits.
